# Project Architecture

The project is a web application containing three main parts:
- Front-end - React.js singe page application
- Back-end - Node.js web-server
- Database - PostgreSQL

### Front-end

In the front-end part we are using:
- React.js - library for building dynamic and interactive user interfaces
- Material-UI - library for creating responsive and user-friendly design
- D3.js - library for building interactive graphs based on data
- Axios - library for communication between front-end and back-end via HTTP

### Back-end

In the front-end part we are using:
- Node.js - JavaScript runtime to execute JS code in command line
- Express.js - fast and minimalist web framework for Node.js
- JWT - library for secure user authentication
- Bcrypt.js - library for encoding sensitive data such as passwords
- Sequalize.js - promise-based Node.js ORM for SQL databases
